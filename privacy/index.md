# Privacy FAQ

Last update: November 7th, 2014

### What information do you collect?

We collect the following data:

* IP addresses
* Website usage patterns (e.g. clicks)
* E-mail addresses of our newsletter subscribers

### How do you collect the information?

We use server logs, cookies, Google Analytics and MailChimp to collect the
information.

### How do you use the information?

We collect the data for the sole purpose of making Golem a better product for
our users. <strong>We DO NOT and WILL NOT share your information with anyone</strong>. Keep
in mind, though, that we use third-paty tools for data acquisition and storage,
so their privacy policies apply here as well:

* [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/legal)
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies)

### What control do I have over my personal data?

Newsletter subscribers can unsubscribe by clicking a link found in the footer
of a newsletter e-mail. The e-mail is then permanently removed from our
database.

Other than that, we do not provide any tools for managing personal data, but –
as Golem grows as a product – we hope to provide such functionality in the
future.

### How do you protect my personal data?

We use SSL/TLS throughout our technology stack. In practice it means you can
safely use our services even on public Wi-Fi.

Your e-mail, obtained through newsletter subscription form, is stored securely
on MailChimp servers.

### How can I contact you regarding privacy?
